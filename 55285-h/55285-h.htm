<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="small italic">Mr Granger, at the close of his Biographical History of England, says, "I shall conclude this volume with
observing, that Lord Bacon has somewhere remarked, that biography has been confined within too narrow limits; as
if the lives of great personages only deserved the notice of the inquisitive part of mankind. I have, perhaps, in the
foregoing strictures extended the sphere of it too far. I began with Monarchs, and have ended with Ballad-Singers,
Chimney-Sweepers, and Beggars. But they that fill the highest and the lowest classes of human life, seem, in many
respects, to be more nearly allied than even themselves imagine. A skilful anatomist would find little or no difference, in
dissecting the body of a king and that of the meanest of his subjects; and a judicious philosopher would discover a
surprising conformity, in discussing the nature and qualities of their minds."</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="uppercase"><span class="drop-cap1">B</span>eggary</span>,
of late, particularly for the last six years, had
become so dreadful in London, that the more active
interference of the legislature was deemed absolutely
necessary; indeed, the deceptions of the idle and sturdy
were so various, cunning, and extensive, that it was in
most instances extremely difficult to discover the real
object of charity from the impostor.</p>

<p>Concluding, therefore, from the reduction of the
metropolitan beggars, that several curious characters would
disappear by being either compelled to industry, or to
partake of the liberal parochial rates provided for them
in their respective workhouses, it occurred to the author
of the present publication, that likenesses of the most
remarkable of them, with a few particulars of their habits,
would not be unamusing to those to whom they have
been a pest for several years.</p>

<p>In order to convince his readers that he does not stand alone as a delineator of
mendicants, he begs leave to observe, that several of the very first-rate artists have
studied from them.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo Buonarotti often drew from beggars; and report says, that in the
early part of his life, when he had not the means of paying them in money, he would
make an additional sketch, and, presenting it to the party, desire him to take it to some
particular person, who would purchase it. Fuseli, in his life of Michael Angelo, says that
"a beggar rose from his hand the patriarch of poverty." The same artist, in one of his
lectures, delivered at the Royal Academy, also observes, that "Michael Angelo ennobled
his beggars into Patriarchs and Prophets, in the ceiling of the Sistini Chapel."</p>

<p>Annibal Caracci frequently drew subjects in low life. His "Cries of Bologna,"
etched by Giuseppe Maria Mitelli, pub. 1660, in folio, are evidently from real characters.
It will also be recollected, that some of the finest productions of Murillo, Jan Miel, and
Drogsloot, are beggars. Callot's twenty-four beggars are evidently from nature; and
among Rembrandt's etchings are to be found twenty-three plates of this description.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently painted from beggars, and from these people have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
originated some of his finest pictures, particularly his "Mercury as a Pickpocket," and
"Cupid as a Link-boy." His Count Ugolino, was painted from a pavier, soon after he
had left St George's Hospital from a severe fever. Mr West painted the portrait of a
beggar, on the day when he became a hundred years old; and considered him as a
pensioner for several years afterwards. The same person was used also as a model by
Copley, Opie, &amp;c. Who can forget the lovely countenance of Gainsborough's Shepherd's
Boy, that has once seen Earlom's excellent engraving from it? He was a lad well known
as a beggar to those who walked St James's Street thirty years ago. The model for the
celebrated picture of the Woodman, by the same artist, is now living in the Borough, at
the venerable age of 107.</p>

<p>Mr Nollekens, in 1778, when modelling the bust of Dr Johnson, who then wore a
wig, called in a beggar to sit for the hair. The same artist was not equally fortunate in
the locks of another great character, for on his application to a beggar for the like
purpose, the fellow declined to sit, with an observation that three half-crowns were not
sufficient for the trouble.</p>

<p>The late Mr Nathaniel Hone, in the year 1850, painted the portrait of James Turner,
a common beggar, who valued his time at a shilling an hour. Captain Baillie has made
an etching of this picture.</p>

<p>That truly spirited painter, Mr Ward, made similar overtures to a lame sailor, who
thought fit to reject them and prefer his begging occupation.</p>

<p>One of the many fine things produced by Flaxman, is a figure of a blind sailor,
Jack Stuart, mentioned in page 19 of this work. The artist has introduced him in a
beautiful monument, erected in Campsal Church, to the memory of Misses Yarborough.</p>

<p>Beggars have not only been useful to artists as models, but serviceable to them in
other instances. Francis Perrier, who was born of poor parents, when a boy entered
into the service of a blind beggar, for the express purpose of getting from France to
Rome to pursue his studies in that city; and Old Scheemaker, the sculptor, Nollekens's
master, absolutely begged his way from Flanders to Rome for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Though the biographical part of this publication exhibits some curious customs of
the London beggars which have fallen within the author's observations, and though it
may in some instances be deemed original, yet he confesses that he has adopted the usual
craft of the common vender, who invariably puts the best sample into the mouth of the
sack. Such, he needs not state the truly interesting Introduction to be; it was written
and presented to him by his honoured and valuable friend, <span class="smcap">Francis Douce</span>, Esq.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="uppercase"><span class="drop-cap1">T</span>he</span> present work is very far from being offered as a general view of that
peculiar branch of pauperism, which includes the many wandering classes
of mankind that are supported by the casual and irregular bounty of others,
or by means that have at least the appearance of industry or honourable
ingenuity; for that would be a task requiring the united efforts of the historian, the
legislator, and the antiquary. It may be deemed sufficient to submit to the reader's
notice, such accounts and gleanings as immediately relate to the particular characters
which are here once more embodied and presented to him by the aid of the graphic art.
In the mean time, a slight sketch of the state and progress of mendicity in former ages
may be neither unacceptable nor without its use.</p>

<p>The Beggar's calling, if not one of the most respectable, may doubtless be regarded
as one of the most ancient. In every part of the globe where man is congregated, the
inequality of his condition, the too frequent indolence of his habits, or the shifts to which
human misery is occasionally reduced, will compel him to depend for his support on the
generosity of his fellow-creatures, and even sometimes lead him to prefer this disgraceful
state of existence. The sacred volume has supplied us with evidence of the mendicant
profession at an early period. King David, when imprecating curses on the head of his
enemy, prays that "his children be continually vagabonds, and <i>beg</i>;"
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
and the story of Ulysses and the beggar Irus, as related in one of the
oldest works extant, is known almost to every one.</p>

<p>The state of mendicity among the Greeks and Romans is but obscurely recorded,
nor have any specific laws or regulations that they might have framed relating to that
subject been transmitted to us. The beggars in Horace, who lamented the death of the
musician Tigellinus, were probably of the common kind, though some have supposed
them to have been fortune-tellers or prophets. Their dress would be of the ragged sort,
the <i>mendicula impluviata</i> of Plautus. We learn from Seneca, that the beggars of his
time practised every species of imposture, and even amputated their limbs for the
purpose of exciting compassion.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, we meet with a few legislative acts relating to the vagrant
classes. In a capitulary of the Emperor Charlemagne, beggars were prohibited from
wandering about the country; and another ancient law of the Franks is cited by Beatus
Rhenanus in his German chronicle, by which every city is ordered to maintain its own
poor, who are nevertheless to be compelled to manual labour, or otherwise not to be
entitled to relief; a vagrant life is also strictly prohibited. For a considerable time the
kingdom of France was much infested with a set of itinerant beggars, usually known by
the appellation of <i>Truands</i>, and their occupation by that of <i>Truandise</i>; from which
terms our own language has adopted an obvious word of much significance. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
people likewise gave name to one of the streets of Paris, called <i>La Truanderie</i>; and,
under pretence of begging alms, committed the most atrocious crimes and excesses
practising every kind of fraud and imposture; so that the name gradually became the
representative of every thing that was bad and infamous. In later times they were
called <i>Argotiers</i>. They assumed the form of a regular government, elected a king, and
established a fixed code of laws, and a language peculiar to themselves, constructed
probably by some of the debauched and licentious youths who, abandoning their
scholastic studies, associated with these vagabonds. The facetious author of a poetical
life of the famous French robber Cartouche, has given a very humorous account of the
origin of the word <i>Argot</i>, which, at the expense of graver etymologists, he derives from
the ship Argos; contending that this <i>jargon</i>, a term that would perhaps have supplied
the real and perverted meaning of the other, was either invented by the navigators of
that celebrated vessel, for the purpose of deceiving his majesty of Colchos, or constructed
by Agamemnon at Argos, and transported afterwards to Troy, where the Greek generals
used it to harangue their soldiers. The same writer has likewise compiled a dictionary
of the language in question, which is given at the end of Cartouche's history. Their
king assumed the title of the <i>Great Chosroes</i>, in imitation of the Persian monarch of that
name, and his officers had their several cant denominations contrived with considerable
ingenuity. One of these sovereigns thought fit to prefer his own name, and was called
<i>Roi de Thunes</i>. This fellow used to be drawn triumphantly through the streets in a
little cart by two stout dogs, and at length finished his career on a gibbet at Bourdeaux.
The new members of this honourable fraternity were graciously received by the monarch,
and consigned to his officers for instruction. These taught them to counterfeit wounds,
sores, and ulcers, by means of the juice of celandine and other herbs; to make preparations
of grease, &amp;c., for the purpose of hindering dogs from barking, and many other
tricks and contrivances essential to the profession of a beggar. The necessary qualifications
for an officer at court, was the possession of masks, rags, plaisters, bandages,
crutches, and other matters calculated to excite charity and compassion; a candidate for
the monarchy, which was elective, must have passed through one or more offices, and
have sported a limb in all appearance shockingly diseased, but curable in a day's time.
The royal habits were composed of a thousand bits of rag, of various colours. Every
year the king held a council of his officers and subjects, who reported their proceedings,
and paid him the legal and accustomed tribute money; offences were inquired into, and
summary punishment inflicted. Many of the above officers were runaway scholars and
debauched priests, who taught the novices the <i>Argot</i> language, and performed other
duties which exempted them from the usual tribute to the sovereign. These impostors
were divided into numerous classes, assuming various appellations. Those who counterfeited
maimed soldiers were called <i>Narquois</i>, corresponding with our Rufflers. The little
urchins, who before the establishment of regular hospitals were permitted to beg in
groups, and appeared as half-starved, were denominated <i>Orphelins</i>, or <i>Orphans</i>. Fellows
assuming the character of broken merchants and tradesmen, called themselves <i>Marcandiers</i>
and <i>Rifodés</i>; these, pretending to have been ruined by war, by fire, and other
calamities, made use of false certificates of their loss, and were frequently accompanied
by their wives and children. The <i>Malingreux</i> were the dropsical and otherwise diseased
impostors, who frequented the churches, and demanded alms to enable them to make
pilgrimages and perform masses to particular saints. The <i>Hubins</i> shewed certificates of
having been bitten by wolves or dogs, and placed themselves under St Hubert's protection.
The <i>Coquillarts</i> pretended to have made a pilgrimage to St James or St Michael,
and sold their cockle-shells even to those fools who had done so. The <i>Sabouleux</i> counterfeited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
demoniacs, by means of soap held in the mouth, with which they produced their
foam, and exhibited false wounds on their heads and bodies, which they pretended to
have inflicted on themselves during their fits. These last were the most faithful subjects
of the <i>Great Chosroes</i>, and paid him a much higher tribute than any of the rest. Besides
the above, there were the <i>Pietres</i>, the <i>Courtaux</i>, the <i>Polissons</i>, the <i>Capons</i>, the
<i>Francmitoux</i>, and a variety of others, all assuming different characters, to defraud the
unwary in every possible manner. These particulars have been collected together as
exhibiting a general view of the manners and practices of the begging tribe in the
kingdom of France, where the regulations concerning them appear to have been very
frequent and severe. In the reign of Francis I. many edicts of the court issued against
them, by some of which all the beggars in Paris were compelled to clear the city sewers
and ditches, and to assist in repairing the fortifications; and for this purpose the police
officers seized upon all that were able-bodied and competent to work. Many were
banished to the provinces, and if they continued to beg, and refused to assist in the
vintage, they were ordered to be hanged. Whipping was the more general punishment;
and where licensed, they were not suffered to go about in troops, but confined to travel
in Paris only, to prevent robberies and other mischief. Those who could not labour, on
account of infirmity, were maintained in hospitals, or by contributions at the churches,
where they were not permitted, as at present, to beg, under pain of whipping. In the
admirable Pictures of Paris by Mercier, there is an interesting article on the sturdy
beggars of that city, where their noisy orgies at their places of rendezvous, when they
have stripped themselves of their false limbs and hideous plasters, are eloquently
described. He mentions one cruel and wicked practice among these impostors, namely,
that when they steal other people's children for want of their own, they distort and even
dislocate the members of the unfortunate victims, to give them what they impiously
term the arms and legs of God Almighty.</p>

<p>With respect to the vagabonds of Spain, who will be found to resemble, with small
difference, many of the classes above described, it will be sufficient to refer the reader to
those excellent novels, Lazarillo de Tormes, and Guzman de Alfarache. The manners of
the Italian mendicants and impostors are admirably depicted, with many entertaining
stories, in the very curious work of Rafael Frianoro, entitled, "Il vagabondo, overo sferzo
de bianti e vagabondi," <i>Viterbo</i>, 1620, 12mo, in which the catalogue of names of the
parties, and of the impostures practised, far exceeded those of any other country.</p>

<p>Della Valle, in his travels to the East Indies, informs us, that the beggars there make
use of a trumpet to express their wants, frequently terrifying the people into charity by
their loud clamours. Of the Chinese mendicants, some particulars will be found in
explaining one of the plates of this work.</p>

<p>It would amount to positive negligence, if, in the present sketch, those wanderers
that are usually known among ourselves by the appellation of Gypsies, and on the continent
by that of Bohemians, on account of their first appearance in that country, were
passed over without some notice; but their history has been so learnedly and copiously
detailed by M. Grellmann, that it may be thought sufficient on this occasion to advert to
the English translation of that excellent work by Mr Raper, published 1787, in quarto.</p>

<p>Nor should the mention of the orders of mendicant friars be omitted, who, no doubt,
had their prototypes in the knavish priests of Cybele. Of these persons there were four
orders,&mdash;viz., the Augustinians, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, and the Minorites. They
wandered from place to place, professing poverty, and exciting the charity of others.
They had assumed and acquired an unlimited control over the consciences of the deluded
victims of their artifice, and at length became particularly odious to the monks and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
clergy in general, continuing nevertheless to maintain their power and influence, from
the marked favour and protection of the Roman Pontiffs, who regarded them as some of
their best friends and supporters. In our own country these people encountered a most
bitter and inveterate enemy in the celebrated Wickliffe, who, in his sermons and other
works, declaimed against them with much vehement eloquence as thieves, hypocrites,
and children of Judas Iscariot; telling them that Christ never commissioned any one to
appear in the character of a beggar; and that, although he preferred a state of poverty,
he never demanded alms himself, nor allowed of others doing it, but in cases of extreme
necessity.</p>

<p>Another set of ecclesiastical mendicants were those pseudo-monks, who, among many
other irregularities, scrupled not to take to themselves wives, whilst their brethren contented
themselves with concubines. These were branded by the regular monks with the
appellation of <i>Beghards</i>, and are specially termed <i>sturdy beggars</i>, in a very bitter invective
against them by Felix Hammerlein, a civilian and canon of Zurich, in the fifteenth
century, who emphatically calls them the legitimate sons of Belial. Many other writers
declaimed against them with great acrimony, and some of the more rigid Papists seem to
have classed them among the <i>Lollards</i>, an appellation that has very much arrested the
attention of the learned in etymology, though without any certainty as to its origin.</p>

<p>The records of our early history supply few, if any, materials that throw light upon
the subject before us; and the laws of the Saxons, as well as those of our British
ancestors, are entirely silent as to any regulation concerning vagrants or mendicants of
any kind. A curious incident however in the life of Edward the Confessor, as related
by his historian Alured of Rievaulx, is worthy of being mentioned. This sovereign is
said to have been remarkable for his benevolence to the poor, many of whom he privately
supported. Among these was one Ralph, a Norman, a miserable object, whose limbs
were shockingly contracted by disease. This man, scarcely able to creep along on his
knees, as was the usual practice with such persons, and urged by necessity, the mother
of invention, was the first who is reported as making use of a hollow vessel of wood, in
the form of a bason, in which he placed his hinder parts, guiding and supporting his
crippled limbs by means of his hands, and thus sailed along, as it were, upon the ground.
On the king's death he made a pilgrimage to his tomb, and addressing himself to the
monarch as if alive, was healed, as says the legend, of his disease.</p>

<p>The next two centuries of English history are equally barren of incident to our purpose.
From that time, however, the statute laws of the kingdom furnish abundant
regulations concerning the vagrant classes, and it has therefore been thought worth while
to submit to the reader's notice the following extracts and abridgments.</p>

<p>The statute of labourers, made in the 23d year of Edw. III., recites that there are
many sturdy beggars, who prefer a life of indolence to active labour, and commit theft
and other crimes; and therefore, with a view to discourage such practices, and compel
these persons to work for their living, it enacts that none, on pain of imprisonment, shall,
under colour of pity or of alms, give anything to those who are competent to labour, or
presume by such means to "<i>favour them towards their desires</i>."</p>

<p>By Stat. xii. Rich. II. c. 6, every beggar who is able to work shall be put in the
stocks, and such as are unable to work shall abide in the cities and towns where they be
dwelling at the time of proclaiming this statute; and if the inhabitants shall not be able
to maintain them, then the said beggars shall withdraw themselves to other places within
the hundred, rape, or wapentake, or to the places of their nativity, within forty days as
above, and there continually abide during their lives; and all that go in pilgrimage as
beggars, but are able to work, shall be punished with the stocks, unless they have letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
testimonial from a justice of the peace. The sheriffs and gaolers are also charged with
the custody of beggars, though it does not appear for what particular offence. Religious
persons and hermits who beg must have licence from their ordinaries, and scholars of the
universities from their chancellors, under the like penalties.</p>

<p>The Stat. xix. Hen. VII., adverting to the rigour of the last-mentioned regulations,
and to the great expense of confining vagabonds and beggars in prison, enacts, that an
immediate discharge from the gaols shall take place, and all beggars be set in the stocks
for a day and a night, without other food than bread and water, and then sent to the
place of their nativity, or where they may have resided for the space of three years. It
also enacts, that such beggars as are not able to work be passed to their own towns,
where only they are to be allowed to beg.</p>

<p>By Stat. xxii. Hen. VIII., persons unable to work are to be licensed by certificate
from mayors, sheriffs, bailiffs, or justices, to beg within certain districts; and if they be
found begging without such licence, they are to be set in the stocks for three days and
three nights, and fed only on bread and water, or else whipped, at the discretion of the
magistrate, who is afterwards to give the party a licence and dismiss him. Persons being
"whole and mighty in body, and able to labour," and found begging, are to be whipped
at the cart's tail till blood come, and then dismissed to their own district, receiving a
licence, stating their punishment, and authorising them to beg by the way. Scholars at
the universities begging without licence, to be punished as above. Persons wandering
about with unlawful games, and fortune-tellers of all kinds, to be punished for the first
offence by two days whipping; for the second, by like whipping, with subsequent pillory
and loss of one ear; for the third, the like punishment, with loss of the other ear. The
licence was in these words,&mdash;"Memorandum, that A. B. of Dale, for reasonable considerations,
is licensed to beg within the hundred of P. K. in the county of L.;" and the licence
after whipping is as follows,&mdash;"I. S., whipped for a vagrant strong beggar, at Dale, in the
county of L., according to the law, the 22 July, in the 23 year of King Henry the Eighth,
was assigned to pass forthwith and directly from thence to Sale, in the county of M.,
where he saith he was born, or where he last dwelled by the term of three years, and he
is limited to be there within fourteen days next ensuing, at his peril," &amp;c.</p>

<p>By this act, persons delivered from gaol, or acquitted of felonies, who could not pay
the usual fees, were to be licensed by the keeper to raise such fees by begging for the
space of six weeks, on pain of whipping for default of such licence.</p>

<p>By the 27th Hen. VIII., further provisions were made for the labour and employment
of vagabonds and beggars. Churchwardens to gather alms for supporting the poor
on Sundays and holidays. Begging children, between the ages of five and fourteen
years, to be placed under masters of husbandry; and those between the ages of twelve
and sixteen to be whipped for running away. Beggars offending again after the first
punishment, to be marked by cutting off the upper gristle of the right ear; and if found
still loitering in idleness, to be indicted as felons at the quarter sessions, and on conviction
to suffer death. The mendicant friars are specially excepted in this act, which provides
many additional supports for the poor besides the vast donations from the still existing
monasteries, and the almshouses and hospitals.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the reign of Edw. VI., a most severe and extraordinary
statute was made for the punishment of vagabonds and relief of poor persons. It does
not appear who were the contrivers of this instrument, the preamble and general spirit
of which were more in accordance with the tyrannical and arbitrary measures of the
preceding reign, than with the mild and merciful character of the infant sovereign, who
is well known to have taken a very active part in the affairs of government. It repeals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
all the former statutes on this subject, and enacts, that if any beggar or other person,
not being lame or impotent, and after loitering or idly wandering for the space of three
days or more, shall not offer himself to labour, or being engaged in any person's service
shall run away or leave his work, it shall be lawful for the master to carry him before a
justice of peace, who, on proof of the offence, shall cause the party to be marked with a
hot iron with the letter V on the breast, and adjudge him to be his master's slave for
the space of two years, who shall feed him "on bread and water, or, at his discretion, on
refuse of meat, and cause the said slave to work, by beating, chaining, or otherwise, in
such work or labour (how vile soever it be) as he shall put him unto." If the slave
should run away, or absent himself for a fortnight without leave, the master may pursue
and punish him by chaining or beating, and have his action of damage against any one
who shall harbour or detain him. On proof before the justice of the slave's escape, he
is to be sentenced to be marked on the forehead or ball of the cheek with a hot iron
with the letter S, and adjudged to be his master's slave for ever; and for the second
offence of running away, he is to be regarded as a felon and suffer death. The children
of beggars to be taken from them, and, with other vagrant children, to be apprenticed
by the magistrate to whoever will take them; and if such children so apprenticed run
away, they are to be retaken, and become slaves till the age of twenty in females, and
twenty-four in males, and punishment by chains, &amp;c., and power to the master to let,
sell, or bequeath them, as goods and chattels, for the term aforesaid. If any slave
should maim or wound the master in resisting correction, or conspire to wound or
murder him, or burn his house or other property, he is to suffer death as a felon, unless
the master will consent to retain him as a slave for ever; and if any parent, nurse, or
bearer about of children, so become slaves, shall steal or entice them away from the
master, such person shall be liable to become a slave to the said master for ever, and the
party so stolen or enticed away restored. If any vagrant be brought to a place where
he shall state himself to have been born, and it shall be manifest that he was not so
born there, for such lie he shall be marked in the face with an S, and become a slave to
the inhabitants or corporation of the city for ever. Any master of a slave may put a
ring of iron about his neck, arm, or leg, for safe custody; and any person taking or
helping to take off such ring, without consent of the master, shall forfeit the sum of ten
pounds.</p>

<p>This diabolical statute, after remaining for two years, was repealed, on the ground
that, from its extreme severity, it had not been enforced, and instead of it the xxii.
Hen. VIII. was revived. The taking apprentices the children of beggars was, however,
continued; but instead of slavery for the offence of running away, the punishment of
the stocks was substituted. In the last year of King Edward's reign, further provisions
for supporting the poor were made, by gathering alms at church by the parish officers,
who were "gently to ask and demand of every man and woman what they of their
charity will be contented to give weekly toward the relief of the poor, and the same to
be written in a register or book." The collectors are empowered to make such of the
poor labour as they shall think fit; but none are permitted "to go, or sit openly, <i>a
begging</i>."</p>

<p>The last statute that it will be necessary to refer to, is that of the xxxix. Eliz. c. 4,
for the punishment and suppression of rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars, by which
houses of correction are for the first time established; and all persons calling themselves
scholars, and going about begging, fellows pretending losses by sea, persons using
unlawful games, fortune-tellers, procurers, collectors for gaols and hospitals, fencers,
bearwards, common players of interludes, minstrels (except such players as are licensed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
by any baron of the realm), jugglers, tinkers, pedlars, common labourers able in body
but begging and refusing labour for reasonable wages, persons delivered from gaol and
begging for fees, all persons whatever that beg in any manner as wanderers, and all
gypsies or pretending to be so, shall be adjudged rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars,
and be liable to the punishment of whipping till the blood come, and passed to their
respective parishes, and committed to the house of correction until further provision by
work, or placing in almshouses. If any of the above persons shall appear to be dangerous
to the inferior sort of people, or will not otherwise be reformed, they shall be
committed to the house of correction or county gaol, and at the quarter-sessions, if
necessary, banished from the kingdom to such places as shall be assigned by the privy
council, or otherwise be sent to the galleys of the kingdom for life, with pain of death
on returning from banishment. No vagabonds or beggars to be imported from Ireland,
Scotland, or the Isle of Man, or, if already here, to be sent back to their respective
countries. No diseased poor persons to be suffered to repair to the baths of Bath or
Buxton for cure, unless they forbear to beg, and are licensed by two justices; and that
the above cities be not charged with finding relief for such persons. This statute not to
extend to children under seven years old, nor to <i>glassmen</i> of good behaviour, travelling
with licence, and forbearing to beg.</p>

<p>It is impossible to look upon a more finished picture of the general manners of the
begging classes, a little before the Reformation, than in the following extract from the
once deservedly celebrated satire entitled the <i>Ship of Fools</i>. Although of foreign
construction, it is not the less calculated for the meridian of England; and indeed the
translator has in some degree adapted it to his own country. The author thus addresses
the parties in question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All vacabondes and myghty beggers, the whyche gothe beggynge from dore to dore, and
ayleth lytell or nought, with lame men and crepylles, come unto me, and I shall gyve you an

<p>In the year 1566, Thomas Harman, Esq., probably a justice of peace, published a
very singular and amusing work, entitled, "A Caveat, or Warning for Common Cursetors
(runners) vulgarely called Vagabones;" in which he has described the several sorts of
thieving beggars and other rogues with considerable humour, and has collected together
a great number of words belonging to what he humorously calls the "leud lousey language
of these lewtering luskes and lazy lorrels, wherewith they bye and sell the common
people as they pas through the countrey." He says they term this language <i>Pedlar's
French</i>, or, <i>Canting</i>, which had not then been invented above thirty years. As the book
has lately been reprinted, it will be proper, on this occasion, to use it more sparingly, and
to mention only such of Harman's vagabonds as fall under the begging class. These are
1. The <i>Rufflers</i>; particularly mentioned in the Stat. xxvii. Henry VIII. against vagabonds,
as fellows pretending to be wounded soldiers. These, says Harman, after a year or two's
practice, unless they be prevented by twined hemp, become,&mdash;2. <i>Upright Men</i>; still pretending
to have served in the wars, and offering, though never intending, to work for
their living. They decline receiving meat or drink, and take nothing but money by way
of charity, but contrive to steal pigs and poultry at night, chiefly plundering the farmers.
Of late, says the author, they have been much whipped at fairs. They attack and rob
other beggars that do not belong to their own fraternity, occasionally admitting or
installing them into it by pouring a quart of liquor on their pates, with these words, "I
do stall thee, W. T., to the rogue, and that from henceforth it shall be lawful for thee to
cant for thy living in all places." All sorts of beggars are obedient to them, and they
surpass all the rest in pilfering and stealing. 3. <i>Hookers</i>, or <i>Anglers</i>; these knaves beg
by day, and pilfer at night, by means of a pole with a hook at the end, with which they
lay hold of linen, or any thing hanging from windows or elsewhere. The author relates
a curious feat of dexterity practised by one of them at a farm house, where, in the dead
of the night, he contrived to hook off the bed-clothes from three men who were lying
asleep, leaving them in their shirts, and when they awoke from cold, supposing, to use
the author's words, "that Robin Goodfellow had bene with them that night." 4. <i>Rogues</i>;
going about with a white handkerchief tied round the head, and pretending to be lame.
These people committed various other frauds and impostures, in order to obtain charity.
5. <i>Pallyards</i>; with patched garments, collecting, by way of alms, provisions, or whatever
they could get, which they sold for ready money; they are chiefly Welshmen, and make
artificial sores by applying spearwort to raise blisters on their bodies, or else arsenic or
ratsbane to create incurable wounds. 6. <i>Abraham Men</i>; pretending to be lunatics,
who have been a long time confined in Bedlam or some other prison, where they have
been unmercifully used with blows, &amp;c. They beg money or provisions at farmers'
houses, or bully them by fierce looks or menaces. 7. <i>Traters</i>; or fellows travelling about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
the country with black boxes at the girdle, containing forged briefs, or licences to beg
for hospitals. Some have clouts bound round their legs, and walk as if lame, with staves
in their hands. 8. <i>Freshwater Mariners</i>, or <i>Whipjacks</i>; whose ships, says the witty
author, were drowned in Salisbury Plain. These counterfeit great losses at sea by shipwreck
and piracy, and are chiefly Irishmen, begging with false licences, under the supposed
seal of the Admiralty, so artfully constructed as to deceive even the best lawyers.
9. The <i>Counterfeit Crank</i>; who is described at large, with a figure, in another part of this
work. 10. <i>Dommerars</i>; chiefly Welshmen, pretending to be dumb, and forcibly keeping
down their tongues doubled, groaning for charity, and keeping up their hands most
piteously, by which means they procure considerable gains. 11. <i>Demanders for glymmar</i>;
who are chiefly women that go about with false licences to beg, as sufferers from fire,&mdash;glymmar,
in pedlars' language, signifying that element. Many other classes are enumerated
in this curious volume, as&mdash;priggars of prauncers, swadders, jarkman, patricos, bawdy
baskets, autem morts, walking morts, doxies, dells, kynchin morts, and kynchin coes; but
all these are rather pilferers than beggars.</p>

<p>As every trade or profession had its patron saint, so the beggars made choice of St
Martin, who appears to have had a great regard for them. This person was originally a
soldier of rank in the armies of the Emperors Constantius and Julian, but preferring a
religious life, he applied to Saint Hilary, of Poitou, who appointed him his sub-deacon;
and soon afterwards becoming a saint himself, he of course acquired the power of working
miracles, many of which, with much other legendary matter, have been related by his
credulous but elegant historian, Sulpitius Severus, and transferred, with due additions
and improvements, into that grand repertory of pious frauds, the Golden Legend, and
some other works of similar authority. It is related of him, that when a soldier, as he
passed by one of the gates of Amiens in winter time, he met a poor naked man, on whom
none would bestow alms. Martin drew out his sword, and cutting his mantle asunder in
the middle, gave one half to the poor man, having nothing else to bestow on him, contenting
himself with the remainder to keep him from the cold. On the ensuing night he
saw the Saviour of the world in heaven, clothed with that part which he had given to
the poor man, and exclaiming to the angels that surrounded him, "Martin, yet new in
the faith, hath covered me with this vesture." Ever afterwards he became particularly
attached to beggars and poor people. The cripples and lepers seem, however, to have
made exclusive choice of St Giles for their patron, to whom the hospitals and other places
for their relief were usually dedicated. So the parish church of Cripplegate was
dedicated to him; and the ward itself, named after a very ancient gate to which the
crippled beggars particularly resorted. There would be some difficulty to account for
their preference of this Saint, as he does not appear to have been either lame or leprous.
He was a noble Christian, born at Athens, a man of singular charity, giving largely to
the poor, and on one occasion doing more than St Martin, by giving the <i>whole</i> of his coat
to a diseased and naked beggar, who is said to have been immediately healed on putting
it on.</p>

<p>As an exemplification of the legend of Saint Martin might be acceptable to many
readers, it has been thought fit to select, as an appropriate embellishment, one of the
oldest figures of the Saint that remain, and to place it before the title of the work. This
print has been copied with scrupulous fidelity from an ancient engraving in copper, in
the truly valuable collection of Thomas Lloyd, Esq., by a German artist, whose name
unfortunately has not been preserved, and who probably executed it between the years
1460 and 1470. In this instance the story has not been correctly adhered to, for the
designer of the print has there introduced a <i>couple</i> of beggars; an error that is sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
compensated by the variety it affords of the mendicant costume, one of these fellows
making use of a creeper and dish, the other of a crutch. A later print of this subject,
and of extreme curiosity on all accounts, may likewise be consulted. It is from a design
by Jerom Bosche, an artist of grotesque celebrity, and represents Saint Martin in a boat
full of beggars, with crowds of others on shore, in every possible form and attitude. It
is accompanied with the following inscription, in the Flemish language: "The good Saint
Martin is here represented among the crippled, nasty, wretched tribe, distributing to
them his cloak, instead of money; the miserable crew contending for the spoil."</p>

<p>In the year 1741, a spirited presentment to the Court of King's Bench was made by
the Grand Jury of Middlesex, against the unusual swarms of sturdy and clamorous
beggars, as well as the many frightful objects exposed in the streets; in which they state,
that notwithstanding a very strong presentment to the same effect had been made by a
former jury in 1728, they had found the evil rather increased than remedied. This they
ascribe to negligence in the proper officers, and trust that a proper remedy will be applied,
and themselves not troubled with the poor, at the same time that they are every day
more and more loaded with taxes to provide for them; and that his Majesty's subjects
may have the passage of the streets, as in former happy times, free and undisturbed, and
be able to transact the little business to which the decay of trade has reduced them,
without molestation.</p>

<p>In the last session of the present Parliament, the matter has been again taken up
with a degree of skill and vigour that reflects great honour on its conductors; and we
may indulge a hope to see the streets of the Metropolis freed from the many public and
disgusting nuisances that have increased with its population, and the real objects of
charity and compassion humanely and properly cherished and protected, as well as the
vast and oppressive expense of supporting them reduced.</p>

<p>Already we perceive the alarm has been taken by the members of the mendicant
tribes; and it may not be too much to add, that the interest and curiosity of the present
work are likely to augment, in proportion as the characters that have led to its composition
shall decrease in numbers. That they should entirely disappear, may be more than
can be reasonably expected.</p>

according to the old adage, find a
port in every storm. The appeal of "My
worthy heart, stow a copper in Jack's
locker,&mdash;for poor Jack has not had a quid
to-day," is as piercingly felt by the lowly
cottager as the British Admiral.</p>

<p>Who can recollect Bigg's pathetic picture
of the "Shipwrecked Sailor-boy," or
Mrs Ludlam's charming poem of "The Lost
Child," without shedding the tear of
sympathy?</p>

<p>The public are not, however, to conclude,
that because a fellow sports a jacket
and trousers, he must have been a seaman;
for there are many fresh-water sailors,
who never saw a ship but from London
Bridge. Such an impostor was Jack Stuart,
Flaxman's model, whose effigy is attached
to the capital letter of this page. Jack's latter history is truly curious. After lingering
for nearly three months, he died on the 15th of August 1815, aged 35. His funeral was
attended by his wife and faithful dog, Tippo, as chief mourners, accompanied by three
blind beggars in black cloaks; namely, John Fountain, George Dyball, and John Jewis.
Two blind fiddlers, William Worthington and Joseph Symmonds, preceded the coffin,
playing the 104th Psalm. The whimsical procession moved on, amidst crowds of spectators,
from Jack's house, in Charlton Gardens, Somers Town, to the churchyard of St
Pancras, Middlesex. The mourners afterwards returned to the place from whence the
funeral had proceeded, where they remained the whole of the night, dancing, drinking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
swearing, and fighting, and occasionally chaunting Tabernacle hymns; for it must be
understood, that most of the beggars are staunch Methodists. The person from whom
these particulars were obtained, and who was one of the party, thought himself extremely
happy that he came off with a pair of black eyes <i>only</i>. The conduct of this man's
associates in vice was however powerfully contrasted by the extraordinary attachment
and fidelity of Jack's cur, Tippo, his long and stedfast guide, who, after remaining three
days upon his master's grave, refusing every sort of food, died with intermitting sighs
and howling sorrow. The dog of Woollett, the engraver, died nearly a similar death.</p>

<p>The following plate exhibits Stuart's pupil, George Dyball, a fellow of considerable
notoriety. He sometimes dresses as a sailor, in nankeen waistcoat and trousers; but
George, like his master, never was a seaman. Stuart taught him to maund, by allowing
him to kneel at a respectful distance, and repeat his supplications.</p>

<p>Dyball was remarkable for his leader, Nelson, whose tricks displayed in an extraordinary
degree the sagacity and docility of the canine race. This dog would, at a word
from his master, lead him to any part of the town he wished to traverse, and at so quick
a pace, that both animals have been observed to get on much faster than any other streetwalkers.
His business was to make a response to his master's "<i>Pray pity the Blind</i>" by
an impressive whine, accompanied with uplifted eyes and an importunate turn of the
head; and when his eyes have not caught those of the spectators, he has been seen to
rub the tin box against their knees, to enforce his solicitations. When money was thrown
into the box, he immediately put it down, took out the contents with his mouth, and,
joyfully wagging his tail, carried them to his master. After this, for a moment or two,
he would venture to smell about the spot; but as soon as his master uttered "<i>Come, Sir</i>,"
off he would go, to the extent of his string, with his tail between his legs, apprehensive
of the effects of his master's corrective switch. This animal was presented to Dyball by
Joseph Symmonds, the blind fiddler, who received him of James Garland, another blind
beggar, who had taught him his tricks. Unfortunately for Dyball, this treasure has
lately been stolen from him, as is supposed by some itinerant player, and he is now
obliged to depend on a dog of inferior qualifications, though George has declared him to
"<i>Shew very pretty for tricks</i>."</p>

<p>This custom of teaching dogs to beg with cans in their mouths is not new. A few
years since, there was such an animal in a booth at Bartholomew Fair, who made his
supplications in favour of an Italian rope-dancer. The practice is indeed very ancient, as
appears in a truly curious illuminated copy of the Speculum Humanæ Salvationis, written
in the early part of the fifteenth century, in the possession of a friend of the author.</p>

<p>The next plate is of a beggar well known at fairs near the Metropolis. He is certainly
blind, and perhaps one of the most cunning and witty of his tribe; for in order
that his blindness may be manifest, he literally throws up his eyeballs, as if desirous of
exemplifying the following lines in Hudibras:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   <div class="verse quote">"As men of inward light are wont</div>
   <div class="verse">To turn their optics in upon't."</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>He is a foreigner, and probably a Frenchman; at all events he professed to be so on
the commencement of the war; but having acquired a tolerable stock of English, and
perhaps not choosing to return home, he now declares himself "<i>A poor Spaniard Man</i>."</p>

<p>Sometimes he will, by an artful mode of singing any stuff that comes into his head,
and by merely sounding the last word of a line, so contrive to impose upon the
waggoners and other country people, as to make them believe that he fought in the
field of Waterloo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
"Poor fellow," exclaimed a spectator, "he has been in the battle of Waterloo."
"<i>Yes, my belove friends</i>," returned the mendicant, "<i>De money de money go very low
too</i>."</p>

<p>However, this fellow is now and then detected, in consequence of a picture, which
is painted on a tin plate and fastened to his breast, being the portrait of and worn many
years ago by a marine, who had lost his sight at Gibraltar. His hair, which is sometimes
bushy, is now and then closely put under his hat, or tied in a tail; and when he alters his
voice, he becomes a different character&mdash;the form of a decrepit vender of matches. The
seated beggar in this plate is frequently to be seen at the wall of Privy Chambers; he
never asks charity, nor goes any great distance from Westminster, where he resides.</p>

<p>The following plate of a walking beggar, attended by a boy, was taken from a drawing
made in West Smithfield. The object of it is well known about Finsbury Square
and Bunhill Row; sometimes he stands at the gates of Wesley's meeting-house. His cant
is, "Do, my worthy, tender-hearted Christians, remember the blind; pray pity the stone
dark blind." The tricks of the boy that attended this man when the drawing was made,
brought to mind the sportive Lazarillo De Tormes, when he was the guide of a beggar;
from which entertaining history there are two very spirited etchings by Thomas Wyck,&mdash;the
one, where he defrauds his master when partaking of the bunch of grapes; and the
other, where he revenges a thrashing received from his master by causing him to strike
his head against a pillar, and tumble into a ditch that he was attempting to leap.</p>

<p>The next subject is a tall blind man, with a long staff, with which he strikes the
curbstones. He is seldom to be seen in any particular place, and was drawn when he
stood against the wall of Mr Whitbread's brewhouse.</p>

<p>He is frequently a vender of the penny religious tracts, dispersed by a society of
Methodists, though perhaps with little use, for they are often purchased by people who
are actually going to the gin-shop. It is here stated, on credible authority, that there are
no less than 27,000 of the Methodist and 21,500 of the Evangelical Magazines published
every month; and it is also reported, that not less than 800 Methodistical meeting-houses
have been erected in England within the last year.</p>

<p>The beggar portrayed in the next
plate is a blind man, who remains for many hours successively with his legs in one
position. He observes a profound silence when on his stand, but makes noise enough
when he attends the Tabernacle Walk on the Sabbath; on the week days, however, he
is frequently heard singing obscene songs. He is introduced, with his wife, in the background
of George Dyball's plate.</p>

<p>The next plate affords a remarkable instance of sobriety in a blind man, who never
tasted gin in his life. He was some years since to be found on the historically and
beggarly-famed road of Bethnal Green, and obtained an honest livelihood by trafficking
in halfpenny ballads.</p>

<p>The ensuing etching is of Charles Wood, a blind man, with an organ and a dancing
dog, which he declares to be "<i>The real learned French dog, Bob</i>," and extols his tricks by
the following never-failing address, "<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the real learned
French dog; please to encourage him; throw any thing down to him, and see how
nimbly he'll pick it up, and give it to his poor blind master. Look about, Bob; be sharp;
see what you're about, Bob.</i>" Money being thrown, Bob picks it up, and puts it into his
master's pocket. "<i>Thank ye, thank ye, my good masters; should any more Ladies and
Gentlemen wish to encourage the poor dog, he's now quite in the humour; he'll pick it up
almost before you can throw it down.</i>" It is needless to add, that this man, whose station
is against Privy Garden Wall, makes what is called "<i>a pretty penny</i>" by his learned
French friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>

<p>The two succeeding plates are of a class that must ensure
attention from the gaping multitude, and are commonly termed
industrious beggars.</p>

<p>The female figure is that of Priscilla, an inhabitant of St
James, Clerkenwell, who is often to be seen in the summer
seated against the wall of the Reservoir of the New River
Water-works, Spa-fields, and employed in the making of patchwork
quilts. She threads her own needle, cuts her own
patches, and fits them entirely herself.</p>

<p>The other plate exhibits the portrait of Taylor, a blind shoemaker, who lost
his sight eighteen years since by a blight. This harmless man,
who lives at No. 6 Saffron Hill, maintains a family by his attention to his stands, which
are sometimes at Whitehall, and the wall by Whitfield's Chapel, Tottenham Court Road.
This meritorious pair may be justly regarded as true objects of compassion, as they never
associate with the common street-beggars.</p>

<p>The next plate, which will close the series of blind beggars, exhibits the portrait of
William Kinlock. He was employed many years ago to turn a wheel for a four-post
bedstead turner in Oxford Street, but afterwards lost his sight at Gibraltar, under the
great Lord Heathfield. His stands are at Furnival's Inn and Portugal Street, near which
latter place he resides.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="uppercase"><span class="drop-cap2">In</span>dustrious</span>
beggars are sometimes confounded with
sturdy impostors. Of the latter description is the
man whose figure is given in the next plate. His
employment is to cut a chain out of a piece of ash,
which chain he calls "Turkish Moorings."</p>

<p>After this fellow had agreed to accept two shillings
for half an hour's sitting for the present work,
he had not been seated in the kitchen ten minutes
before he began to nestle, and growled a hope that he
might not be detained long, adding that he could get
twice the money in less time either at Charing Cross
or Hyde Park Corner. In order to soften the brute,
he had the offer of bread, cheese, and small beer. He
said he never took any. At this moment the servant
being employed in making a veal pie, he was asked
whether he would accept of a steak, and take it to a public-house for his lunch. After
slowly turning his head, without giving the least motion of his body, he sneeringly
observed, that the veal had no fat.</p>

<p>It was then determined to keep him the full time; and after a few close questions,
he observed, that no one dared to keep him in prison; that he worked with tools, and was
not a beggar. True it was, indeed, that his hat was on the ground; and if people would
put money into it, surely it was not for him to turn it out. As to his chains, few persons
would give him his price; they were five shillings a yard; nor did he care much to sell
them, for if he did he should have nothing to show. After turning his money over
several times, and for which he did not condescend to make the least acknowledgement, he
exclaimed on leaving the house, "<i>Now that you have draughted me off, I suppose you'll
make a fine deal of money of it</i>."</p>

<p>The annexed representation is of a fellow whose figure was recently copied in
Holborn, and although he was so scandalously intoxicated in the middle of the day that
it was with the greatest difficulty he could stand, yet
many people followed to give him money, because the
inscription on his hat declared him to be "<span class="smcap">Out of
Employment</span>." Such are the effects of imposture,
and the mischief of ill-directed benevolence. As a
contrast to the two preceding characters, see the next
plate, which affords the portraits of two truly industrious
persons, Joseph Thake and his son. These
people are natives of Watford, in Hertfordshire, who
finding it impossible to procure work, and being determined
not to beg, employed themselves in making
puzzles. The boy learned the art when under a shepherd
in Cambridgeshire. These specimens of ingenuity
are made of pieces of willow, which contain
small stones, serving for children's rattles, or as an
amusement for grown persons who, unacquainted
with the key, after taking them to pieces are puzzled
to put them together again. When honest Thake and his son had filled a sack, they
trudged to the great City, where they took their station in St Paul's Churchyard, vending
their toys at the moderate price of sixpence a piece.</p>

<p>Their rustic simplicity quickly procured them customers; among whom the author's
friend, Mr Henry Pocknell, after purchasing a few specimens of their handy-work, procured
for him the pleasure of imitating his example.</p>

<p>The worthy parent transferred the money to his son, who requested that he might
have the satisfaction of presenting his benefactor with a bird.</p>

<p>The succeeding plate displays the effigy of Joseph Johnson, a black, who in consequence
of his having been employed in the merchant service only, is not entitled to the
provision of Greenwich. His wounds rendering him incapable of doing further duty on
the ocean, and having no claim to relief in any parish, he is obliged to gain a living on
shore; and in order to elude the vigilance of the parochial beadles, he first started on
Tower Hill, where he amused the idlers by singing George Alexander Stevenson's "Storm."
By degrees he ventured into the public streets, and at length became what is called a
"Regular Chaunter." But novelty, the grand secret of all exhibitions, from the Magic
Lantern to the Panorama, induced Black Joe to build a model of the ship Nelson, to
which, when placed on his cap, he can, by a bow of thanks, or a supplicating inclination
to a drawing-room window, give the appearance of sea-motion. Johnson is as frequently
to be seen in the rural village as in great cities; and when he takes a journey, the kindhearted
waggoner will often enable him in a few hours to visit the marketplaces of
Staines, Romford, or St Albans, where he never fails to gain the farmer's penny, either
by singing "The British Seaman's Praise," or Green's more popular song of "The Wooden
Walls of Old England."</p>

<p>The following plate presents the portrait of another black man
of great notoriety, Charles M'Gee, a native of Ribon, in Jamaica, born in 1744, and whose
father died at the great age of 108. This singular man usually stands at the Obelisk, at
the foot of Ludgate Hill. He has lost an eye, and his woolly hair, which is almost white,
is tied up behind in a tail, with a large tuft at the end, horizontally resting upon the cape
of his coat. Charles is supposed to be worth money. His stand is certainly above all
others the most popular, many thousands of persons crossing it in the course of the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>

and on that occasion his apparel is appropriately varied.</p>

ancient palace of our kings, Bridewell; but which has, ever since the grant of Edward
VI., been a house of correction for vagabonds, &amp;c. It is a truly curious circumstance, that
this establishment gave name to other prisons of a similar kind; for instance, Clerkenwell
Bridewell, and Tothill-fields' Bridewell. Over the entrance of the latter, the following
inscription has been placed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Doctor Johnson, who generally gave to importunate beggars, never failed to relieve
the silent blind.</p>

<p>Black men are extremely cunning, and often witty; they have mostly short names,
such as Jumbo, Toby, &amp;c., but the last seems of late to be the most fashionable, for it has
not only been used by the master of Mr Punch, the street-strolling puppet, as a name for
that merry little fellow's dog, but by the proprietor of the Sapient Pig.</p>

<p>The last negro beggar called Toby, was a character well known in this Metropolis.
He was destitute of toes, had his head bound with a white handkerchief, and bent himself
almost double to walk upon two hand-crutches, with which he nearly occupied the width
of the pavement. Master Toby generally affected to be tired and exhausted whenever
he approached a house where the best gin was to be procured; and was perhaps of all the
inhabitants of Church Lane, St Giles's, the man who expended the most money in that
national cordial.</p>

<p>But this man was nothing when compared with a Lascar, who lately sold halfpenny
ballads, and whose gains enabled him to spit his goose, or broil a duck; for it is well
known, that upon an average he made not less than fifteen shillings per day.</p>

<p>The author of this little work sincerely regrets the loss of a sketch that he made from
a black man, whose countenance and figure were the most interesting of any of the tribe.
He was nearly six feet in height, rather round in the shoulders, and usually wore a
covering of green baize; indeed altogether he brought to recollection that exquisite statue
of Cicero, in the Pomfret collection of marbles at Oxford, so beautifully engraved by
Sherwin. This fellow, who had often been taken up, has not been seen for several
months.</p>

<p>Go-cart, Billies in bowls, or Sledge-beggars, are denominations for those cripples
whose misfortunes will not permit them to travel in any other
way; and these are next presented to the reader's notice.</p>

<p>Men of this class are to be found in every country. The
little fellow above depicted in the cart is copied from Luca
Carlevarij's 100 Views in Venice, a set of long quarto plates, most
spiritedly etched, and published in 1703.</p>

<p>Hogarth, whose active eye caught Nature in all her garbs, has introduced in his
Wedding of the Industrious Apprentice, a cripple well known in those days under the
appellation of Philip in the Tub, a fellow who constantly attended weddings, and retailed
the ballad of "Jesse, or the Happy Pair."</p>

<p>Dublin has ever been famous for a Billy in the Bowl. A very remarkable fellow of
this class, well known in that city, and who thought proper to leave Ireland on the
Union, was met in London by a Noble Lord, who observed, "So you are here too!"
"Yes, my Lord," replied the beggar, "the Union has brought us all over."</p>

<p>The back view of the person exhibited in the following plate, is that of Samuel
Horsey, who, in December 1816, had been a London beggar for thirty-one years. Of
this man there are various opinions, and it is much to be doubted if the truth can be
obtained even from his own mouth. He states that Mr Abernethy cut off his legs in St
Bartholomew's Hospital, but he does not declare from what cause; so that being deprived
of the power of gaining a subsistence by labour, he was forced to become a beggar. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
some persons he is styled the King of the Beggars, but certainly without the least foundation.
He says that no one has been less acquainted with beggars than himself; and as
for his having the command of a district, that he utterly denies. His walks, or rather
movements, are not always confined; on some days he slides to Charing Cross, but is
oftener to be seen at the door of Mr Coutts's banking-house, perhaps with an idea that
persons just after they have received money are more likely to bestow charity.</p>

<p>Of all other men, Horsey has the most dexterous mode of turning, or rather swinging
himself, into a gin-shop. He dashes the door open by forcibly striking the front of his
sledge and himself against it.</p>

<p>He was once seen in a most perilous situation, when he lodged in a two-pair of stairs
back room, in Wharton's Court, Holborn. He had placed himself on the window-sill, in
order to clean the outside upper panes, and was attached as usual to his sledge, when
unfortunately he broke a square. On this occasion he let loose the volley of oaths which
at other times he can so forcibly discharge; nor did his rage subside after he had launched
himself into the room again; indeed he was heard at intervals to vociferate in this way
for several hours.</p>

<p>The very extraordinary torso etched in the next plate is that of John Mac Nally, of
the county of Tyrone. This poor fellow lost the use of his legs by a log, that crushed
both his thighs, when an apprentice at Cork.</p>

<p>His head, shoulders, and chest, which are exactly those of Hercules, would prove
valuable models for the artist.</p>

<p>Mac, who is well known about Parliament Street, Whitehall, and the Surrey foot of
Westminster Bridge, after scuttling along the streets for some time upon a sledge, discovered
the power of novelty, and trained two dogs, Boxer and Rover, to draw him in a
truck, by which contrivance he has increased his income beyond all belief.</p>

<p>Though this man's dogs when coupled have occasional snarlings, particularly when
one scratches himself with an overstrained exertion, the other feeling at the same time
an inclination to dose, yet, when their master has been dead drunk, and become literally
a log on his truck, they have very cordially united their efforts to convey him to his
lodgings in St Ann's Lane, Westminster, and perhaps with more safety than if he had
governed them, frequently taking a circuitous route during street repairs in order to
obtain the clearest path.</p>

<p>The figure in the box is that of a Jew mendicant, who has unfortunately lost the use
of his legs, and is placed every morning in the above vehicle, so that he may be drawn
about the neighbourhood of Petticoat Lane, and exhibited as an object of charity. His
venerable appearance renders it impossible for a Jew or a Christian to pass without giving
him alms, though he never begs but of his own people; a custom highly creditable to the
Jews, and even more attentively observed by that truly honourable Society of Friends,
vulgarly called Quakers, who neither suffer their poor to beg, nor become burthensome to
any but themselves.</p>

<p>About forty-eight years ago, when the sites of Portland Place, Devonshire Street,
&amp;c., were fields, the famous Tommy Lowe, then a singer at Mary-le-bone Gardens, raised
a subscription to enable an unfortunate man to run a small chariot, drawn by four
muzzled mastiffs, from a pond near Portland Chapel&mdash;called Cockney Ladle, which supplied
Mary-le-bone Basin with water&mdash;to the Farthing Pie-house, a building remaining at
the end of Norton Street, and now the sign of the Green Man, in order to accommodate
children with a ride for a halfpenny. And it is rather extraordinary, that the son of that
very man, a few years since, and after the death of his wife, harnessed a spaniel to a
small cart, but large enough to hold his infant, which the animal drew after the father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
from lamp to lamp through the very streets above mentioned. The dog became so accustomed
to his task, that as soon as he heard his master cover a lamp, away he would
scamper to the next, and there wait the arrival of the ladder.</p>

<p>Street-crossing sweepers next make their appearance; the first on the list being
William Tomlins, whose stand is very productive, as it includes both Albemarle and St
James Streets. Of this man there is nothing further remarkable, beyond his attention
to his pitch, for so the beggars and ballad-singers call their stands. He appears to be
alive to the receipt of every penny, and will not suffer himself by any means to be
diverted from his solicitations; as a strong proof of which, he refused to hold the horse
of a gentleman who called to him for that purpose, and from this it may be inferred that
he thought begging a better occupation.</p>

<p>The next character portrayed is a constant sweeper of the crossing at the top of
Ludgate Hill. This man finds it his interest to wear a cloth round his head, as he is on
that account frequently noticed by elderly maiden city dames, who mistake him for one
of their own sex.</p>

<p>At the time he was drawn, he was so sickly that his
person was not recognised as a vender of matches, in which character he had two years
before been selected as a subject for this work, and whose portrait as such is given in the

finds it his interest to exercise his broom at the above station.</p>

<p>The subjects of the next two plates are unfortunate mendicants. The first is a

<p>The second plate is the portrait of William Frasier, deprived of both his hands in the
field of battle. His allowance as a maimed soldier not being sufficient to maintain his
large family, he is obliged to depend on the benevolence of such of the public who purchase
boot-laces of him. When this poor fellow's portrait was taken, he lodged in Market
Lane, in the house formerly occupied by Torre, the print-seller, who was the original fireworker
at Mary-le-bone Gardens.</p>

<p>London has of late been gradually losing many of its old street customs, particularly
that pleasing one of the milkmaid's garland, so richly decorated with articles of silver
and bunches of cowslips. The garland was of a pyramidal form, and placed upon a horse
carried by two chairmen, adorned with ribbons and tulips. The plate consisted of pint
mugs, quart tankards, and large dishes, sometimes to the value of five hundred pounds,
hired of silversmiths for the purpose. The milkwoman and her pretty maids, in their
Nancy Dawson petticoats, would dance to the fiddler's jigs of "Paddy O'Rafferty," or "Off
she goes," before the doors of their customers; but now, instead of this innocent scene of
May-day gaiety, the streets are infested by such fellows as the one exhibited in the
adjoining plate, who have been dismissed, perhaps for their indecent conduct, from the
public places of entertainment. These men hire old dresses, and join the Chimney
Sweeper's, Cinder-sifter's, or Bunter's Garland, or Jack in the Green, &amp;c., and exhibit all
sorts of grimace and ribaldry to extort money from their numerous admirers.</p>

<p>Few persons, particularly those in elevated life, can witness, or even entertain a true
idea of the various modes by which the lowest classes gain a livelihood. It is scarcely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
be believed that some few years ago a woman, of the name of Smith, regularly went over
London early in the morning, to strike out the teeth of dead dogs that had been stolen
and killed for the sake of their skins. These teeth she sold to bookbinders, carvers, and
gilders, as burnishing tools.</p>

<p>There are women who, on Sunday mornings when there are no carts about, frequent
Thames Street, and the adjoining lanes inhabited by Lisbon merchants, to pick up from
the kennels the refuse of lemons, after they have been squeezed for their juice. These
they sell to the Jew distillers, who extract a further portion of liquor, and thus afford
them the means of selling, at a considerably reduced price, lemon drops to the lower order
of confectioners.</p>

<p>It is seldom that the common beggars eat the food given to them; and it is a well-known
fact, that they sell their broken bread to the lowest order of the biscuit bakers,
who grind it for the purpose of making "tops and bottoms," &amp;c.</p>

<p>This was also the practice in former days, as appears in an old ballad, from which
the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some women gain a living by going from house to house and begging phials. They
pretend that they have an order for medicines at the dispensary, for their dear husband,
or only child, but know not in what way to get it without a bottle, as they are obliged
to take one of their own; at the same time, some will beg white linen rags to dress
wounds with. These they soon turn into money at the old iron shops,&mdash;the "dealers in
marine stores."</p>

<p>Those who beg old shoes, such as Grannee Manoo, make as much as six or seven
shillings a day. They sell them to the people who live in cellars in Monmouth Street, or
stalls in Food and Raiment Alley, Rosemary Lane, &amp;c. These persons give them new
soles, and are called Translators. In Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, a cobbler of the name of
Bates styles himself a translator.</p>

<p>The plate of two Bone-pickers is the next to be described. The physiognomy of the
fellow who is stitching patches together to tack to his coat, which consists of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
hundreds of bits of old velvet, carpets, &amp;c., would baffle the skill of either Lavater or
Spurzheim; it has the mixture of the idiot, the goat, and the bull-dog. Such a visage
might have been useful to Spagnolet, or his pupil Salvator. In order to discover a few
of the habits of this character, he was followed for several hours through many streets,
alleys, and courts, in the parish of St Martin's in the Fields. On his arrival at Moor's Yard,
which is said to have been a place for the execution of public criminals in early times, he
was accused of stealing door mats, and with some difficulty extricated his tatters from
the tugs of a couple of dogs. In Hartshorn Lane, in the Strand, at one time the residence
of Ben Jonson, he was seen to take up a brick, and throw it at two curs fighting for a
bone, which he picked up and put into his bag. These bones are bought by the burners
at Haggerstone, Shoreditch, and Battlebridge, at two shillings per bushel, in which half
a bushel is given over, that being bone measure.</p>

<p>Bill Row and John Taylor, two grubbers, are introduced in the next plate. These
men, with Stephen Lloyd, form the sum total of their description in London. They
procure a livelihood by whatever they find in grubbing out the dirt from between the
stones with a crooked bit of iron, in search of nails that fall from horse-shoes, which are
allowed to be the best iron that can be made use of for gun-barrels; and though the
streets are constantly looked over at the dawn of day by a set of men in search of sticks,
handkerchiefs, shawls, &amp;c., that may have been dropped during the night, yet these grubbers
now and then find rings that have been drawn off with the gloves, or small money that
has been washed by the showers between the stones. These men are frequently employed
to clear gully-holes and common sewers, the stench of which is so great that their breath
becomes pestilential; and its noxious quality on one occasion had so powerful an effect
on a man of the name of Dixie, as to deprive him of two of his senses, smelling and
tasting, and yet Ned Flowers followed this calling for forty years.</p>

    <p>PLATE XXVII.</p>

</div>

<p>But there is still a
more wretched class of beings than the grubbers, who never know the comfort of dry
clothes,&mdash;they are, like the leech, perpetually in water. The occupation of these draggle-tail
wretches commences on the banks of the Thames at low water. They go up to their
knees in mud, to pick up the coals that fall from the barges when at the wharfs. Their
flesh and dripping rags are like the coals they carry in small bags across their shoulders,
and which they dispose of, at a reduced price, to the meanest order of chandler-shop
retailers.</p>

<p>The environs produce characters equally curious with those of London, particularly
among that order of people called Simplers, whose business it is to gather and supply the
city markets with physical herbs. Such an innocent instance of rustic simplicity is
William Friday, whose portrait is exhibited in the following plate. This man starts from
Croydon, with champignons, mushrooms, &amp;c., and is alternately snail-picker, leech-bather,
and viper-catcher.</p>

<p>The man whose portrait is given in the succeeding plate, mimics the notes of the
common English birds by means of a folded bit of tin, similar to that used by Mr Punch's
orator, and which is held between the teeth; but in order to engage the attention of the
credulous, he pretends, as his lips are nearly closed, to draw his tones from two tobacco-pipes,
using one for the fiddle, the other for the bow, and never fails to collect an
attentive audience, either in the street or tap-room.</p>

<p>Musicians of this description were
at one time very numerous. Gravelot, when he kept a drawing-school in the Strand,
made sketches of several. One particularly picturesque, was of a blind chaunter of the
old ballads of "There was a wealthy Lawyer," or "O Brave Nell," and has been admirably
etched by Miller. This man accompanied his voice by playing upon a catgut string
drawn over a bladder, and tied at both ends of a mop-stick; but the boys continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
perplexing him by pricking his bladder, and a pampered prodigal having with a sword
let out all his wind, he fortunately hit upon a mode of equally charming the ear by substituting
a tin tea-canister.</p>

<p>Thomas King, a most excellent painter of conversation-scenes,
who lived at the time of Hogarth, and assisted him in his large pictures of Paul
before Felix in Lincoln's Inn Hall, and the Good Samaritan in Bartholomew's Hospital,
has left portraits of several of these singular beings,&mdash;such as Maddox, the balancer of a
straw; but particularly that of Matthew Skeggs, who played a concerto upon a broomstick,
in the character of Signor Bumbasto, at the little theatre in the Haymarket. These
portraits have been engraved by Houston. That of Skeggs was published by himself, at
the sign of the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes, in St Alban's Street, now a part of Waterloo
Place. Since their time, Mr Meadows, the comedian, has been particularly famous for
his imitations of birds; and some of the lowest description of street vagabonds have
produced tones by playing upon their chins with their knuckles. Another hero of the
knuckle, was the famous Buckhorse, the friend of Ned Shuter, and who formerly sold
sticks in Covent Garden. This fellow grew so callous to the blow of the knuckle, as to
place his head firmly against a wall, and suffer, for a shilling, any wretch to strike him
with his doubled fist, with all his strength, in his face, which became at last more like a
Good-Friday bun than any thing human. Of this man there are many portraits.</p>

<p>Of Scottish, Welsh, and Irish mendicants there are now very few in London; perhaps
their full number does not exceed fifty, unless by including that lower order of street-musicians
who so frequently distract the harmonious ear with their droning bag-pipes,
screaming clarionets, and crazy harps. These people, with match, tooth-pick, and cotton-ball
venders, may be considered but as one remove from beggary.</p>

<p>The lowest class of the Scotch are bakers' men; the women are laundresses. The
Welshmen, of whom London never had many, are principally employed by the potters of
Lambeth, at which place they have an old established house of worship. It is a cheerful
sight to behold their women, who are remarkable for their cleanliness, and, like the
Scotch, are generally pictures of vigorous health. These will go in trains of twenty or
thirty persons, from Hammersmith to Covent Garden Market, joining in one national
melody, and perfuming the air with their baskets of ripe strawberries.</p>

<p>Of all people the poor Irish are the most anxious to gain employment, and are truly
valuable examples of industry. They sleep less than other labourers; for at the dawn of
day they assemble in flocks at their usual stands for hire,&mdash;namely, Whitechapel, Queen
Street, Cheapside, and on the spot formerly occupied by St Giles's pound, at the ends of
Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The most laborious of them are chairmen,
paviers, bricklayers' labourers, potato-gatherers, and basket-men; and, to the eternal
disgrace of the commonalty of the English, these people, as well as the Scotch and Welsh,
are guilty of very few excesses, particularly in that odious practice of drinking, a vice so
much increased by the accommodation of seats in gin-shops, which are the first opened
and last shut in London.</p>

<p>The Irish carry immense loads. A hod of bricks, weighing one hundred and ten
pounds, is carried one hundred and twenty times at least in the course of the day, and
sometimes up a ladder of the height of five stories, and all for two shillings and ninepence
per day. The pavier's rammer, of more than half a hundred weight, is raised not fewer
than two thousand times in the course of the day. <i>What Englishman could do this?</i>
With respect to loads on the head, the Irish surpass all others. Leary makes nothing of
carrying two hundred weight from the Fox under the Hill, near the Adelphi, to Covent
Garden, many times on a market morning; and yet, extraordinary as this may appear,
his feats have been more than equalled by a female. A man of the name of Eglesfield,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
who has sold flowers in Covent Garden for the last thirty-six years, knew an Irish girl
who would often walk under the weight of two hundred pounds. He declares that she
brought a load of one hundred and a half from Newgate Market to Covent Garden on
her head, without once pitching, though it must be observed that this was not potato-weight,
which has always one hundred and twenty-six pounds to the hundred.</p>

<p>The following woodcut represents the humane manner in which cripples are conveyed
from door to door in many parts of Ireland. The following description has been
kindly furnished to the Author by a friend, who has frequently assisted in the conveyance,
and takes no ordinary interest in the condition of the poor.</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/27.jpg" width="362" height="400" alt=""/>
</div>

<p>In the country parts of Ireland, beggars are treated with great tenderness and pious
hospitality. Many of them are recognised as descended from ancient and powerful septs,
which decayed in the revolutions of property and influence. During many years after the
invasion of King Henry, the houses of hospitality (so amply described in Sir John Davis's
Tracts) which were established by the Chiefs for their poor relations and the traveller,
were still kept open; and to this hour, some gentry and farmers provide the itinerant
beggars with a bed as well as food. The alms are generally given in meal, flax, wool,
milk, or potatoes, but seldom in money, except in cities or towns. After receiving a night's
lodging or alms, long and devout prayers are distinctly uttered at the door of the benefactor.
Like the players in Hamlet, they are the brief chronicles of the times, and their
praises of the good frequently contribute to matrimonial connections. In some parts of
the country the beggars have a particular day in the week for appearing abroad, when
they are plentifully supplied for the remaining six; and those who, from loss of limbs, or
other infirmity, are unable to walk, are seated upon barrows, and carried or wheeled from
door to door, by the servants of each house or the casual passenger, an act of piety which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
is not unfrequently performed by members of respectable families. The beggars are seen
in crowds near places of Catholic worship, or pilgrimage, and many of them are distinguished
for great piety and temperance. The English traveller is sometimes surprised
at seeing a venerable figure, clothed in a hair-cloth shirt or tunic, repeating his orisons
on the side of a road, with naked shivering limbs, and a beard which for years has been
unconscious of a razor. Yet in Ireland, as in other places, there are pretended objects, and
beggars who misapply the benefactions of the charitable. They receive no interruption
from the police, except in Dublin, where a large close cart frequently returns to the workhouse
full of discontented mendicants, who have an extraordinary aversion to restraint
upon their freedom, or compulsion to attend the established worship, which is generally
different from their own.</p>

<p>This class of the Irish are by no means unacquainted with the use of wit and
waggery. The celebrated Dr O'Leary used to entertain his friends with some instances
of their ingenuity. As he was riding to Maynooth College, a beggar accosted him for
alms, declaring that he had not received a farthing for three days. The good Doctor gave
him some silver, and being accosted on his return, in the evening, with a similar story, he
upbraided the petitioner with his falsehood, telling him that he was Dr O'Leary. "Oh,
long life to your reverence," said the beggar, "who would I tell my lies to, except my
clargy?"</p>

<p>The parts in and near London mostly inhabited by the Irish poor, are Calmel
Buildings, Orchard Street; Petty France, Westminster; Paddy's Land, near Plaistow;
forty houses on the Rumford Road; and in the parish of St Giles in the Fields. This
latter place, which is their principal residence, is called their colony, and is styled by
them "The Holy Land;" in the centre of it there is a mass of building called "Rats'
Castle."</p>

<p>In the time of Queen Elizabeth, St Giles's was the rendezvous of the beggars; for in
"A Caveat, or Warning, for Common Cursitors, vulgarely called Vagabones, set forth by
Thomas Harman, Esquire," 1567, it appears that Nicoles Genynges, the cranke, went over
"the water into St George's fields," and not, according to the expectation of Mr Harman,
who caused him to be dogged, toward Holborn, or St Giles's in the Fields.</p>

<p>It appears from a very early plan of St Giles's in the Fields, in the possession of Mr
Parton, vestry clerk of that parish, that the lowest class of its inhabitants live on a
portion of sixteen acres formerly called "Pittaunce Croft" (the allowance), which extended
from a large mansion called Tottenhall, the fragments of which were of late supposed to
have been parts of a palace of King John; they have been recently taken down. This
house of Tottenhall was formerly inhabited by a Prebendary of St Paul's; it stood on the
north side of that part of the road called "Tottenham Court," leading from the north end
of Tottenham Court Road to Battle Bridge. The sixteen acres commenced from the above
house, and went on southerly to St Giles's Church, and from thence easterly along the
north side of the High Street to Red Lion Fields (now Red Lion Square).</p>

<p>The streets, lanes, alleys, and courts, forming the nest of houses inhabited by thieves,
beggars, and the poor labouring Irish, are encompassed by a portion of the south side of
Russell Street, formerly called Leonard Street, commencing from Tottenham Court Road,
parts of the west sides of Charlotte and Plumtree Streets, and a part of the north and
round the east of High Street to the first mentioned station of Russell Street. To the
honour of Scotland, not one Scotch beggar is to be found in the dregs or lees of St Giles's.
However wretched and depraved the inhabitants of this spot may now be, they certainly
were worse fifty years ago, for it appears that there was then no honour among thieves;
the sheets belonging to the lodging-houses, where a bed at that time was procured for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
twopence, having the names of the owners painted on them in large characters of red
lead, in order to prevent their being bought if stolen,&mdash;as for instance,</p>

 <p class="center">JOHN LEA,<br />
 LAWRENCE LANE.<br />
 STOP THIEF.</p>

<p>At the same period, the shovels, pokers, tongs, gridirons, and purl pots of the public-houses,
particularly those of the Maidenhead Inn, in Dyott Street (now changed to George
Street), and which was then kept by a man of the name of Jordan, were all chained to
the fire-place. At this house the beggars, after a good day's maunding, would bleed the
dragon, a large silver tankard so called, and which was to be filled with punch only.
There is now a house, the sign of the Rose and Crown, in Church Lane, which was
formerly called the Beggars' Opera; and there was another house so denominated, the
sign of the Weaver's Arms, in Church Lane, Whitechapel.</p>

<p>The last cook-shop where the knives and forks were chained to the table, was on the
south side of High Street. It was kept about forty years ago by a man of the name of
Fussell.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only waggery in public-house customs now remaining, is in the
tap-room of the Apple Tree, opposite to Cold Bath Fields Prison. There are a pair of
handcuffs fastened to the wires as bell-pulls, and the orders given by some of the
company, when they wish their friends to ring, are, to "agitate the conductor."</p>

<p>Most of the kitchens in High Street, from St Giles's Church to the entrance of
Holborn, were sausage, sheep's head, roley poley pudding, pancake, and potatoe cellars.
The last heroine of the frying-pan exhibited a short nose and shining red face, and was
known by the appellation of "Little Fanny." She had fried and boiled for Mrs
Markham, now living in the same house, thirty-three years. Her face had become so
ardent by frequent wipings, that for many years it would not bear a touch.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of Sir Nathaniel Conant, when that able and active magistrate
attended the Committee of the House of Commons, that extensive as mendicity has been
of late, it is by no means to be compared with what it was thirty years ago.</p>

<p>It is very obvious that since the proceedings of the Committee for inquiring into the
state of mendicity, the common beggars have decreased considerably in their numbers;
and although they are still extremely numerous, it appears that where our wonderful
Metropolis is molested with one beggar, there are twenty to be met with in almost every
capital on the continent.</p>

<p>England, justly claiming the palm for the encouragement of every art and science,
has ever been foremost in almsgiving, not only to her own people, but to those of almost
every part of the globe. Nor can any other country boast such parochial poorhouses.
The vast improvements of the streets and public edifices, great as they are, by no means
keep pace with them either as to comfort or expense, of which Marylebone and Pancras
are examples; and to the honour of these parishes, as well as that of St James, their
concerns are regulated, examined, and audited by independent characters of the highest
integrity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great benefit of these asylums for the destitute, and the laws
for the punishment of beggars, the sympathetic heart of the true Christian, a character
unpolluted by the cant of crafty sectarists, is ever open to the tale of the distressed, from
a respect for that excellent doctrine of St Paul, that</p>

 <p class="center">CHARITY NEVER FAILETH.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
The following eulogium on this virtue, is extracted from Mr Hamilton's appeal in
behalf of a religious community which had been deprived of its property during the
French Revolution:&mdash;</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-qc.jpg" width="150" height="173" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="uppercase"><span class="drop-cap2">"C</span>harity</span>
is an emanation from the choicest attribute of
the Deity; it is, as it were, a portion of the Divinity
engrafted upon the human stock; it cancels a
multitude of transgressions in the possessor, and gives
him a foretaste of celestial joys. It whetted the pious
Martin's sword, when he divided his garment with
the beggar; and swelled the royal Alfred's bosom,
while a pilgrim was the partner of his meal. It
influenced the sorrowing widow to cast her mite into
the treasury; and held a Saviour on the Cross, when
he could have summoned Heaven to his rescue. Its
practice was dictated by the law, its neglect has been
censured by the prophets; and when the Lord of the
vineyard sent his only Son, he came not to destroy
the law, but to fulfil it. Other virtues may have a
limit here, but Charity extends beyond the grave. Faith may be lost in endless certainty,
and Hope may perish in the fruition of its object, but Charity shall live for countless
ages, for ever blessing and for ever blessed!"</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
